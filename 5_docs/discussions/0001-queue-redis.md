# ADR 0001 â€” Redis for the Queue

## Context
We need a simple queue supporting push/pop semantics, minimal ops, and quick
local development spin-up.

## Decision
Use Redis list (`LPUSH`/`RPOP`) with a single queue `queue:generate`. Store
job metadata in `job:{id}` hashes.

## Consequences
- Simple to reason about and operate
- At-most-once semantics by default; retries must be implemented by the orchestrator
- Migration path to Kafka if/when needed
