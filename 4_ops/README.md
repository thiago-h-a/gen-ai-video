runbooks.

## Makefile targets

```bash
make help           # list targets
make fmt            # format code where applicable
make lint           # run static checks
make test           # run smoke/unit tests
make build          # docker build all service images
make push           # docker push (requires registry login)
make tag RELEASE=v0.1.0
```
